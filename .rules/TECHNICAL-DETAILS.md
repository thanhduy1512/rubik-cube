# Technical Details

## 3D Transformations

- Using CSS transform-style: preserve-3d
- Perspective set to 1000px for optimal 3D effect
- Transform distances:
  - Desktop: 75px
  - Tablet: 60px
  - Mobile: 75px
- Rotation handling with mouse/touch events
- Smooth transitions for all transformations

## State Management

- Custom useCube hook for cube state
- Face-based color tracking
- Type-safe state with TypeScript
- Efficient state updates
- Proper state initialization

## Component Structure

- Cube component for 3D visualization
- Face components for each cube side
- Piece components for individual cubes
