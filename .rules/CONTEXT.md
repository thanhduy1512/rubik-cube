# Project Context

## Project History

- Started as a 3D Rubik's Cube visualization project
- Initial focus on creating an interactive 3D cube with proper face representation
- Implemented responsive design for different screen sizes
- Added documentation and development rules for maintainability

## Design Decisions

### Technical Stack

- React + TypeScript for type-safe development
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- CSS 3D transforms for cube visualization
- Custom hooks for state management

### Architecture

- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns (components, types, constants, hooks)
- Responsive design considerations
- Performance optimization for 3D transformations

## Technical Constraints

- Browser compatibility for 3D transforms
- Performance considerations for complex animations
- Mobile device limitations
- State management complexity for cube operations

## User Requirements

- Interactive 3D cube visualization
- Smooth rotation and manipulation
- Responsive design for all devices
