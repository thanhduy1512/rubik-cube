# Rubik's Cube Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube visualization and interaction project built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project aims to provide an interactive 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube with features for manipulation, solving, and learning.

## Key Features

### 1. 3D Cube Visualization

- Interactive 3D rendering of the Rubik's Cube
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Face-based color representation

### 2. Cube State Management

- Type-safe state management using TypeScript
- Custom hooks for cube state manipulation
- Face-based color tracking
- State persistence and reset capabilities

### 3. User Interaction

- Mouse/touch-based cube rotation
- Face selection and manipulation
- Responsive controls for different devices
- Visual feedback for interactions

### 4. Technical Implementation

- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- 3D transformations using CSS
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

- Components should be placed in the appropriate section folder
- Types should be defined in the types directory
- Constants should be placed in the constants directory
- Custom hooks should be placed in the hooks directory

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom styles should be placed in the styles directory
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### State Management

- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Keep state management modular and reusable
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all state
- Follow React best practices for state updates

### Performance

- Optimize 3D transformations
- Minimize re-renders
- Use proper React hooks and memoization
- Maintain responsive performance across devices

## Future Enhancements

1. Cube solving algorithms
2. Step-by-step solving guides
3. Timer and move counter
4. Different cube sizes (2x2, 4x4, etc.)
5. Save/load cube states
6. Multiplayer functionality
